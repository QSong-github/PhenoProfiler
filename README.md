# PhenoProfiler : Learning Morphology Representations in Image-based Phenotypic Drug Discovery

**PhenoProfiler** is an advanced tool for phenotypic profiling of cell morphology, to efficiently and effectively extract phenotypic effects of perturbations from high-throughput imaging. PhenoProfiler operates as an end-to-end image encoder, converting multi-channel images directly into low-dimensional quantitative features, thus eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing in non-end-to-end pipeline. For more details, please refer to our [paper]().
